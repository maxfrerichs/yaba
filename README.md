# yaba: yet another bundler abstraction

## Description
yaba is a simple CLI tool built on top of esbuild to bundle JavaScript, CSS (and more to come) using a declarative config.

## Installation
* Clone this repository
* run ```make```
* run ```sudo make install``` to install binary

## Usage
* Create a build.yaml in your project root and apply your changes (look in example/ dir for an example config)
* run ```yaba build```

## Motivation
I wanted to do some coding for fun instead of coding to pay my bills, so I'm building yet another frontend tool. :D
